The data files in this directory are generated with the following input parameters:

(1) The total number of packets launched is 1e6 for each point. When comparing to a ball source, the sum of the energy/fluence should be divided by the number of points used to simulate the effect of a ball source.

(2) The ball source is centred at: [90.77090454101562, 170.47908742804466, 124.069055680822278] with radius = 3 for colin27 mesh.
    This is subject to rounding of the simulator's precision.

(3) The data type is volume-based energy/fluence, as specified with the file name.

(4) The comparison picture shows FullMonte ball source data on the left and golden result on the right. All the data have been adjusted to be unitized. The scale is set to logarithmic so the minimum data used is 1e-4 times of the maximum value.
