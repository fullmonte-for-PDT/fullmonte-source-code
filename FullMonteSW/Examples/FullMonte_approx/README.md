The FullMonte_Approx executable is compiled with the software build and is ready for use. 

The input file "FullMonte_approx.in" stores the input parameters used to generate the data. Please change the data accordingly. IMPORTANT: do not change the order or the format of the file.

The comparison results are saved under the subdirectory /Result/meshName.

These results include:
  (1) a 2D scatter plot generated by MATLAB;
  (2) a visualization figure and an interactive window;
  (3) a text file storing the chi-squared test result, including chi-squared statistic and the corresponding p-value.


To generate all the point source results to approximate the ball source, use the Position executable to find all the positions of the points. The input file "find_pos.in" should be modified accordingly. The naming convention for the points is: "FullMonte_energy_ball_point_i.vtk" where i is the i_th point source.
